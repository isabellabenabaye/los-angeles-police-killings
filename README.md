# Los Angeles County Police Killings (2000 - May 2020)

This repository contains my work exploring the [Los Angeles Times'](https://www.latimes.com/) [database](https://github.com/datadesk/los-angeles-police-killings-data) of deaths at the hands of local police in Los Angeles County. My latest extraction of their database for my output was on June 13, 2020. 

I created a compilation of plots of the findings I wanted to share using R and `ggplot`, `cowplot`, `ggtext`, and `extrafont`.
