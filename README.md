# Los Angeles County Police Killings (2000 - May 2020)

This repository contains my work exploring the [Los Angeles Times'](https://www.latimes.com/) [database](https://github.com/datadesk/los-angeles-police-killings-data) of deaths at the hands of local police in Los Angeles County. My latest extraction of their database for my output was on June 13, 2020. 

My exploratory data analysis was done in python using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `bokeh`, and `plotly`. 

I created a compilation of plots of the findings I wanted to share using R and `ggplot`, `cowplot`, `ggtext`, and `extrafont`.
